Assignment 2: The Algorithmic Audit
Overview：

This audit examines three recurring forms of statistical distortion: Latency Skew, False Positives, and Survivorship Bias.

Rather than being calculation errors, these issues arise from structural weaknesses in data collection, sampling, and inference. Each distortion creates the illusion of improved performance, stronger effects, or higher success rates by systematically omitting part of the underlying data-generating process.

The objective of this audit is to identify how these distortions occur and outline disciplined methods for preventing them.

Key Findings：

Latency Skew artificially inflates or deflates performance
When outcome data are observed over unequal time windows, partially matured cohorts are compared against fully matured ones. This creates misleading trend improvements.

False Positives convert randomness into “signal”
When multiple hypotheses are tested without correction, statistical noise is mislabeled as meaningful effect. Significance alone is not proof of impact.

Survivorship Bias overstates success rates
By excluding failed or dropped cases, datasets exaggerate effectiveness and hide risk exposure.

All three distortions stem from incomplete denominators
The common structural flaw is missing observations — whether across time, hypothesis space, or population.

Conclusion：

Statistical lies rarely involve fabricated data. Instead, they arise from structural blind spots in sampling and inference design.

Latency Skew distorts time.

False Positives distort inference.

Survivorship Bias distorts population visibility.

The unifying lesson is simple:

If the denominator is unstable, the conclusion is unreliable.

Strong analytics requires structural discipline — not just statistical computation.
