# 📊 Assignment 2: The Algorithmic Audit

This audit examines how seemingly “strong” metrics can systematically mislead decision-makers when robustness, base rates, or missing data are ignored.

The analysis is structured around three statistical failure mechanisms.

---

## 🧱 1. Latency Skew & Fragile Metrics

**Problem:** Aggregate latency metrics were distorted by a small number of extreme delays.

**Method:**
Compared **Standard Deviation (SD)** with **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)** under simulated heavy-tail conditions.

**Finding:**

* SD increased dramatically after introducing a small cluster of extreme outliers
* MAD remained stable and better reflected typical system behavior

**Insight:**
Metrics based on squared deviations are fragile under skew.
Robust statistics are essential in heavy-tailed environments.

## 🎯 2. False Positives & Base Rate Neglect

**Problem:** A classifier advertised “98% accuracy” without accounting for prevalence.

**Method:**
Conducted a Bayesian posterior audit:
[
P(\text{True Event} \mid \text{Flagged})
]
across varying base rates.

**Finding:**

* In low-incidence environments, the majority of flagged cases were false positives
* High sensitivity and specificity did not translate into reliable decision quality

**Insight:**
Accuracy without base rate context is statistically misleading.
Ignoring prevalence converts strong-looking metrics into institutional risk.

## 🧬 3. Survivorship Bias & Missing Failures

**Problem:** Performance was reported using only surviving entities.

**Method:**
Simulated full population outcomes using a heavy-tailed (Pareto) distribution and compared:

* Full population mean
* Survivor-only mean

**Finding:**

* Survivor-only averages were orders of magnitude higher
* Excluding failures created a false narrative of consistent success

**Insight:**
Deleting failures is equivalent to altering the data-generating process.

## ✅ Key Takeaway

Statistical distortions rarely arise from incorrect arithmetic.
They emerge from flawed structural assumptions.

* Latency skew hides temporal incompleteness
* False positives hide prevalence structure
* Survivorship bias hides population attrition

Robust metrics, Bayesian reasoning, and full denominator visibility are not optional — they are foundational to analytical integrity.
