# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Hi! I’m an undergraduate economics student building a digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. I’m actively preparing for roles in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]** and using this repository to demonstrate how I connect **traditional economic reasoning** with **modern data science workflows**.

## About this Portfolio

This repository hosts my **coursework, labs, and applied exercises** from ECON 3916. The course emphasizes a **Concept Extension** approach: we start with core statistical foundations (e.g., OLS regression and inference) and extend them into scalable machine learning methods (e.g., **regularization with Lasso**) to handle higher-dimensional data and improve out-of-sample performance.

My goal in this portfolio is to show that I can work across two complementary perspectives:

- **Causal inference:** asking “what is the effect?” using econometric thinking, identification logic, and careful interpretation.
- **Predictive analytics:** asking “what will happen next?” using machine learning models, validation, and performance-focused evaluation.

In other words, I’m learning to **bridge explanation and prediction**—bringing economic intuition to model design while using data-driven methods to strengthen empirical analysis.
