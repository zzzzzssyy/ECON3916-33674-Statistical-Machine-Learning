# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Hi! I’m an undergraduate economics student building a digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. I’m actively preparing for roles in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]** and using this repository to demonstrate how I connect **traditional economic reasoning** with **modern data science workflows**.

## About this Portfolio

This repository hosts my **coursework, labs, and applied exercises** from ECON 3916. The course emphasizes a **Concept Extension** approach: we start with core statistical foundations (e.g., OLS regression and inference) and extend them into scalable machine learning methods (e.g., **regularization with Lasso**) to handle higher-dimensional data and improve out-of-sample performance.

My goal in this portfolio is to show that I can work across two complementary perspectives:

- **Causal inference:** asking “what is the effect?” using econometric thinking, identification logic, and careful interpretation.
- **Predictive analytics:** asking “what will happen next?” using machine learning models, validation, and performance-focused evaluation.

In other words, I’m learning to **bridge explanation and prediction**—bringing economic intuition to model design while using data-driven methods to strengthen empirical analysis.

## Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis (Big Mac Index)

### Objective  
Evaluate the **Law of One Price** by using Big Mac prices across countries to infer **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** exchange rates and assess whether currencies appear **overvalued or undervalued** relative to the U.S. dollar.

### Methodology  
- **Assembled the dataset** from *The Economist*’s **2015 Big Mac Index** figures, manually structuring country-level observations into a clean, analysis-ready table.  
- **Computed Implied PPP exchange rates** by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. price benchmark (i.e., the exchange rate that would equalize Big Mac prices across countries).  
- **Measured currency misalignment** by calculating the percentage difference between the implied PPP rate and the prevailing market exchange rate, interpreting results as **overvaluation** (currency stronger than PPP) or **undervaluation** (currency weaker than PPP).  

### Key Findings  
- The results indicate meaningful **departures from PPP**, consistent with the idea that identical goods can trade at different effective prices across countries due to frictions such as taxes, trade costs, wages, and market segmentation.  
- **[Insert your finding]**: For example, I found that the **Norwegian Krone was overvalued by X%** against the U.S. dollar, implying that—relative to the PPP benchmark—the Krone’s market value made Norway’s Big Mac price appear high in USD terms.  
- These misalignments suggest that **arbitrage is limited** in practice: even when price gaps imply potential profit opportunities, real-world constraints prevent the rapid equalization of prices that the Law of One Price would predict.
